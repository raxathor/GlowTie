Welcome to the source for the [Glowtie](http://glowtie.io)! The Glowtie is a light-up bowtie you control over Wifi. The onboard ESP8266 puts out an access point network you can connect to with your phone. Navigate to 192.168.4.1 in your browser and you'll find the Glowtie control page, where you can change the colors and the patterns of the lights.
